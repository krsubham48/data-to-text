# Data-to-Text System

This repository is a brief description of the work I did during my Summer Internship at [cuddle.ai](http://www.cuddle.ai), a subsidiary of [Fractal Analytics Pvt. Ltd.](https://fractalanalytics.com). I cannot share the codes due to the Non-Disclosure Agreement signed. The Problem presented, the Approach I took and the Results obtained is displayed below.

## Introduction

Data-to-text systems are systems that generates texts from non-linguistic input data. Such systems needs to perform data analysis as well as linguistic processing. Data-to-text systems are powerful in generating reports from data automatically and thus they simplify the representation of complex data with numerous datapoint.
<br /><br />
Data-to-text Systems are primarily comprised of two sub-systems:
<br /><br />
1.	Numerical Insights Extraction
2.	Natural Language Generation
<br /><br />
The architecture of a typical data-to-text system is shown below:

## Conclusion

Data-to-Text Systems are extremely useful. Large amount of data is generated on daily basis and its hard for a human to handle such amount of data in less time. Data-to-Text Systems acts as a bridge between huge amount of available data and the hidden insights within.
<br /><br />
The data-to-text system created during my internship gives can act as a start to create a state-of-art Natural Language Generation system. The data generated can be collected in a database, which can later be used to train a Deep Learning Sequence models.
<br /><br />
The system created has a large scope for improvement. The sentences generated can be reframed to be more presentable and useful for business purpose. An extensive survey about the expected output can be useful to get a more clear vision about future works. More relevant words can be added to the dictionary to provide more variety in generated text. The type of statistical information displayed can be varied depending upon the business requirements and use.  The implemented Data-to-Text system is seen to capture insights that are difficult to recognise by merely seeing the visualisation and it is impossible to capture by seeing just the raw data. The system automatically forms easily readable sentences when just the key words and phrases are provided. The rules of grammar are handled with reasonable accuracy.
